## Contact Manager Backend

A backend API for managing contacts, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Overview

The Contact Manager Backend is a RESTful API designed to handle the backend operations of a contact management application. This project allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their contact lists. The API is built using Node.js and Express, and it leverages MongoDB for data storage.

### Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login functionality using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Contact Management**: Endpoints to create, read, update, and delete contacts.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures the integrity of data with comprehensive validation and sanitization.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to provide meaningful responses to API consumers.
- **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind to handle a large number of users and contacts.
- **Security**: Implements security best practices to protect user data.
